## Introduction
    This API is documented in the **OpenAPI format** and provides programmatic access to Port and its components.  
    
    The API describes the various routes available for use, and can be used directly from the browser by using the `Send API Request` button on the right side of each route's page.

    Port is API-first, meaning that this API allows you to achieve any and all of its functionalities.  
    You can *read from* and *write to* your software catalog, execute & interact with your self-service actions, fetch & update your scorecards, and much more.

    ## Authentication
    
    To use the API, you need to obtain a Bearer API key from your Port application:

    1. Go to your [Port application](https://app.getport.io), click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and select `Credentials`.
    2. Click on the `Generate API token` button, and copy the generated token.

    3. Paste the token into the `bearer` field in the request block of your desired route.
