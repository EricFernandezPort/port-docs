# Pages

Port API's `pages` endpoints will undergo a structural change in the near future. The new structure will be more intuitive and easier to use.

| Change  | Example Implication  | ETA  |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| Add validations, restrictions, and clearer error messages for the widgets schema. | If extra or invalid properties are sent, you will receive a descriptive error showing which one. You should delete the properties and match the current schema. |   |
| Add validations, restrictions, and clearer error messages for the pages schema.   | For example, the API will block creating two home pages and require you to keep only one.                                             |   |
| Enforce a dashboard widget wrapper when creating a new dashboard page.            | If you try to create a dashboard page without wrapping the widget, the API (or Terraform) will return an error requiring you to add the wrapper in the JSON. |   |

Until the new structure is released, you can refer to the [Swagger API documentation](https://api.port.io/swagger/#Pages) for the available endpoints and their usage.

Currently, the `pages` endpoints allow you to:

- **Create**, **update**, **delete**, and **get** pages.
- **Create**, **update**, and **delete** widgets.
- **Update** and **get** page permissions.

:::danger pages api beta status
The Pages API is currently in beta, in its current form it lacks certain validations and protections and it could render your portal unusable if used incorrectly.

If you choose to use the Pages API please understand this risk.

In case you use the Pages API and encounter issues, please reach out at [support.port.io](http://support.port.io/) for assistance.
