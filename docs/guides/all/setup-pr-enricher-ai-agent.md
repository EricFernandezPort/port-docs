# Set up the Pull Request Enricher AI agent

## Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up a "Pull Request Enricher" AI agent in Port.  
By the end of this guide, your developers will receive automated, contextual comments on their pull requests to help streamline the review process.

<img src="/img/ai-agents/AIAgentPREnrichierGitHubComment.png" border="1px" />






## Common use cases

- Automatically comment on new pull requests with assessments based on PR metadata
- Highlight potential areas of concern
- Provide context from related Jira tickets directly in the PR comments
- Suggest relevant reviewers based on code changes

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have:
- A Port account with the [AI agents feature enabled](/ai-agents/overview#access-to-the-feature).
- Appropriate permissions to create and configure AI agents.
- [GitHub integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/) configured in your Port instance.
- [Jira integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/project-management/jira/) configured in your Port instance.

## Set up data model

First, we'll need to create the Pull Request Enricher AI agent in Port.  
We will need to configure:
- The data sources it will use to analyze pull requests.
- The agent configuration that defines its capabilities.
- An automation to trigger the agent when new pull requests are opened.

### Configure data source access

For this guide, we will be using **GitHub** as our data source to provide comprehensive pull request analysis capabilities.
Make sure you have [Port's GitHub app](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/) installed and configured.

:::info Additional data sources
While this guide uses GitHub, you can enhance the agent's capabilities by adding other data sources like:
- PagerDuty for checking active incidents
- Your software catalog services for broader context
:::

### Create the agent configuration

1. Go to the [AI Agents](https://app.getport.io/_ai_agents) page of your portal
2. Click on `+ AI Agent`
3. Toggle `Json mode` on
4. Copy and paste the following JSON schema:

   <details>
   <summary><b>Pull Request Enricher agent configuration (Click to expand)</b></summary>

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "identifier": "pr_assistant_ai_agent",
     "title": "PR Review Assistant",
     "description": "AI agent that analyzes pull requests and provides helpful context for reviewers",
     "icon": "Pipeline",
     "properties": {
       "description": "Comment on open PRs with additional context to assist developers",
       "status": "active",
       "allowed_blueprints": [
         "githubPullRequest",
         "githubRepository",
         "githubUser",
         "jiraIssue",
         "_user",
         "_team"
       ],
       "prompt": "Analyze pull request details and provide a structured review in the following format:\n\nPR Description:\n Summarize the PR description and key properties in one sentence \n\nKey Points:\n{{ List up to 3 key insights about the changes }}\n\nObservations:\nProvide up to 3 observations using 游릭 for low risk, 游리 for medium risk, and 游댮 for high risk\n\nRecommendations:\nList up to 3 optional recommendations for improvement.provide this in markdown form",
       "execution_mode": "Automatic"
     }
   }
   ```
   </details>

5. Click on `Create` to save the agent

### Create the automations

We'll need two automations:
1. One to trigger the AI agent when a PR is opened
2. Another to post the agent's response as a comment

#### Trigger PR enricher AI agent

1. Go to the [Automations](https://app.getport.io/automations) page
2. Click on `+ Automation`
3. Copy and paste the following JSON schema:

  <details>
    <summary><b>PR Enricher agent trigger automation (Click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
      "identifier": "pr_opened_to_agent",
      "title": "Upon PR opened, trigger PR Assistant",
      "description": "Automation to trigger PR Assistant when a new PR is opened",

      },

          "labels": {
            "source": "Automation",
            "prNumber": "{{ .event.diff.after.properties.prNumber }}",
            "repo": "{{ .event.diff.after.relations.repository }} "
          }
        }
      },
      "publish": true
    }
    ```
  </details>

4. Click on `Create` to save the automation

#### Post PR enricher AI agent response on GitHub

This automation requires a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope to post comments on pull requests. Store this token as a secret in Port.

1. **Create GitHub PAT:** Follow GitHub's guide to [create a fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with **Read and Write** permissions for **Pull requests** for the repositories you want the agent to comment on.

2. **Add Secret to Port:**
   - Go to the [Secrets page](https://app.getport.io/secrets) in your Port application.
   - Click `+ Create Secret`.
   - Set the `Key` to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
   - Paste your GitHub PAT into the `Value` field.
   - Click `Create`.

3. Go back to the [Automations](https://app.getport.io/automations) page
4. Click on `+ Automation`
5. Copy and paste the following JSON schema:
   <details>

  :::info Replace Placeholders
  Make sure to replace 'YOUR_GITHUB_ORG' and 'YOUR_GITHUB_REPO' in the `url` field above with the actual organization and repository where your `post-pr-comment.yml` workflow resides.

6. Click on `Create` to save the automation

### Create the GitHub workflow

Now let's create the workflow file that contains the logic to post the comment.   

<GithubDedicatedRepoHint/>

In your dedicated workflow repository, ensure you have a `.github/workflows` directory.
1. Create a new file named `post-pr-comment.yml`  
2. Copy and paste the following snippet:
      <details>
      <summary><b>Post PR comment workflow (Click to expand)</b></summary>

        ```yaml showLineNumbers

          name: Comment on PR

              inputs:

2. **Start with basic assessment**: Begin with simple risk assessment and gradually add more context as you see how the agent performs.
3. **Monitor responses**: Regularly review the agent's comments to ensure they're helpful and accurate.
4. **Iterate on the prompt**: Refine the prompt based on the quality of responses and specific needs of your team.
5. **Test the workflow**: Create test pull requests to verify the entire flow works as expected.
6. **Troubleshoot**: If you're not getting the expected results, check our [troubleshooting guide](/ai-agents/interact-with-the-ai-agent#troubleshooting--faq) for common issues and solutions.

## Possible enhancements

You can further enhance the PR Enricher setup by:

- **Integration expansion**: [Add more data sources](/ai-agents/build-an-ai-agent#step-2-configure-data-access) like:
  - PagerDuty for checking active incidents
  - GitLab or Azure DevOps for additional PR context

- **Automated actions**: [Configure the agent](/ai-agents/interact-with-the-ai-agent#actions-and-automations) to:
  - Automatically assign reviewers based on code changes
  - Add relevant labels to the PR (e.g., based on Jira issue type)
  - Create related Jira tickets for follow-up tasks

- **Custom risk assessment**: Enhance the agent's prompt to:
  - Include organization-specific risk factors
  - Consider team-specific guidelines
  - Reference internal documentation

- **Monitor and improve**: [Check how your developers are interacting](/ai-agents/interact-with-the-ai-agent#ai-interaction-details) with the agent and:
  - Gather feedback on the quality of comments
  - Track which suggestions are most helpful
  - Adjust the prompt based on real usage patterns
