# Enrich security vulnerabilities using AI

This guide demonstrates how to leverage 3rd-party AI tools within Port to get additional details on security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.

## Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and that you have finished the [onboarding process](https://docs.getport.io/quickstart).
- You will need at least one code security tool integrated. You can check our [integrations section](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/code-quality-security/).
- You will need access to the LLM API you wish to integrate (e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT).
- You should have a security issue blueprint set up in your Port installation (such as the `snykVulnerability` blueprint).

## Set up data model

To enrich security vulnerabilities with AI-powered insights, we'll first set up the required data model in Port. This includes configuring the necessary fields in your security issue blueprint and setting up API access to your chosen AI provider.

### Configure API Access

To configure the AI integration with your LLM provider, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Port [settings page](https://app.getport.io/settings/secrets).
2. Click on "Add new secret".
3. Enter a name for your secret (e.g., `gpt_token`).
4. Paste your LLM API token (e.g., OpenAI API key).
5. Click "Save".

For more information about managing secrets in Port, see the [secrets documentation](https://docs.getport.io/sso-rbac/port-secrets/).

### Required Blueprint Fields

This guide requires two fields in your security issue blueprint:

1. **CVE ID Field**: Stores the vulnerability identifier
2. **AI Summary Field**: Stores the AI-generated insights

First, ensure your blueprint has the CVE ID field:

1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page
2. Find your security issue blueprint
3. Click "Edit JSON"
4. Add the following field to your blueprint's properties:

   ```json
   {
     "cveID": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "CVE ID",
       "description": "The CVE identifier for this security vulnerability"
     }
   }
   ```

Next, add the AI summary field to store the generated insights:

1. In the same blueprint JSON
2. Add the following field to your blueprint's properties:

   ```json
   {
     "ai_summary": {
       "type": "string",
       "title": "ai_summary",
       "format": "markdown"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Click "Save" to update the blueprint

## Create self-service actions

Now that we have our data model set up, we'll create the necessary actions to integrate with the AI service. This involves creating a self-service action to trigger the AI analysis and an automation to handle the response.

### Create AI Analysis Action

First, let's create the action that will send the CVE information to the AI service:

1. Navigate to the [Self-service tab](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) in your Port application
2. Click on "New action"
3. Click on "Edit JSON" and paste the following configuration:

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "identifier": "enrichSecurityVulnerabilityUsingAI",
     "title": "Enrich security vulnerability using AI",
     "icon": "Codacy",
     "trigger": {
       "type": "self-service",
       "operation": "DAY-2",
       "userInputs": {
         "properties": {},
         "required": [],
         "order": []
       },
       "blueprintIdentifier": "snykVulnerability"
     },
     "invocationMethod": {
       "type": "WEBHOOK",
       "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
       "agent": false,
       "synchronized": true,
       "method": "POST",
       "headers": {
         "RUN_ID": "{{ .run.id }}",
         "Content-Type": "application/json",
         "Authorization": "Bearer {{ .secrets.gpt_token }}"
       },
       "body": {
         "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
         "messages": [
           {
             "role": "system",
             "content": "you are a security expert and should help remediate issues. Lookup for this CVE and provide in markdown few sentences on what is it and how to resolve. Limit to 500 chars. Return in markdown formatting."
           },
           {
             "role": "user",
             "content": " {{ .entity.properties.cveID }} "
           }
         ]
       }
     }
}
```

4. Click "Create" to save the action

### Create Response Handler Automation

Next, we'll create an automation to handle the AI service's response and update the security issue with the generated insights:

1. Navigate to the [Automations](https://app.getport.io/settings/automations) page
2. Click on "New automation"
3. Click on "Edit JSON" and paste the following configuration:

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "identifier": "updateSecurityIssueWithAIResponse",
     "title": "Update security issue based on AI",
     "trigger": {
       "type": "automation",
       "event": {
         "type": "RUN_UPDATED",
         "actionIdentifier": "enrichSecurityVulnerabilityUsingAI"
       },
       "condition": {
         "type": "JQ",
         "expressions": [".diff.after.status == \"SUCCESS\""],
         "combinator": "and"
       }
     },
     "invocationMethod": {
       "type": "UPSERT_ENTITY",
       "blueprintIdentifier": "snykVulnerability",
       "mapping": {
         "identifier": "{{ .event.diff.after.entity.identifier }} ",
         "properties": {
           "ai_summary": "{{ .event.diff.after.response.choices[0].message.content }}"
         }
       }
     },
     "publish": true
}
```

4. Click "Create" to save the automation

## Execute the actions

Now that we have set up our data model and created the necessary actions, let's test the AI enrichment functionality:

1. Navigate to your security issues page in Port.
2. Select a security issue that has a CVE ID.
3. Click on the "..." menu.
4. Select "Enrich security vulnerability using AI".
5. Wait a few seconds for the action to complete.
6. Refresh the page.
7. You should now see the AI-generated summary in the "AI Summary" field.

![AI-generated summary for CVE-2022-48196](/img/guides/ai-security-summary-example.png){border="1px"}

The image above shows an example of an AI-generated summary for CVE-2022-48196, demonstrating how the AI provides:

- A brief explanation of the vulnerability.
- Potential impact.
- Recommended remediation steps.

By following these steps, you've set up an AI-powered system to help developers understand and fix security vulnerabilities more effectively ðŸŽ‰

:::info AI Integration
The integration uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model by default, but you can modify the configuration to use other AI models:

- Change the `url` in the action configuration to point to your preferred AI service (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, or your own hosted model).
- Adjust the prompt in the `content` field to match your use case (e.g., focus on specific vulnerability types or include company-specific mitigation policies).
- Modify the response parsing in the automation if the AI service returns a different format (the current automation expects the response in the OpenAI API format).
- Update the model parameter in the configuration to use a different model version or provider-specific model identifier.

:::tip API Authentication
Remember to update your API authentication headers according to your chosen AI provider's requirements.
