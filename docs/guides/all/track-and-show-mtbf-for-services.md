# Track and show MTBF for services

This guide demonstrates how to implement **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** tracking for your PagerDuty services using Port. MTBF measures the average time between service failures and helps identify reliability trends.

**MTBF = Total Operational Time รท Number of Failures**

For example: A service running 720 hours with 3 incidents has an MTBF of 240 hours. Higher MTBF values indicate better reliability.

## Common use cases

- **Reliability monitoring**: Track how often your services fail and identify patterns over time.
- **SLA compliance**: Monitor service reliability against defined targets and SLAs.  
- **Incident reduction**: Identify the most unreliable services that need improvement focus.
- **Team accountability**: Track reliability metrics by team and service ownership.
- **Capacity planning**: Use historical failure patterns to inform infrastructure decisions.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:
- You have a Port account and have completed the [onboarding process](/getting-started/overview).
- Port's [PagerDuty integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty) is installed in your account.
- Access to your PagerDuty organization with incident data for your services.


## Set up data model

If you haven't installed the [PagerDuty integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty), you'll need to create blueprints for PagerDuty services and incidents.  
However, we highly recommend installing the [PagerDuty integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty) to have these automatically set up for you.

### Create PagerDuty service blueprint


1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.

2. Click on `+ Blueprint`.

3. Click on the `{...}` button in the top right corner, and choose `Edit JSON`.

4. Add this JSON schema:

    <PagerDutyServiceBlueprint />

5. Click `Save`.



### Create PagerDuty incident blueprint  


1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.

2. Click on `+ Blueprint`.

3. Click on the `{...}` button in the top right corner, and choose `Edit JSON`.

4. Add this JSON schema:

    <PagerDutyIncidentBlueprint />

5. Click `Save`.



### Add aggregation properties

First, we need to add aggregation properties to count incidents over different time periods. 
These properties will count the number of PagerDuty incidents related to each service within specific time windows.

Follow the steps below to add aggregation properties to the PagerDuty Service blueprint:

1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.

2. Click on the **PagerDuty Service** blueprint.

3. Click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and choose `Edit JSON`.

4. Add these aggregation properties to the blueprint JSON:

    <details>
    <summary><b>Incident count aggregation properties (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
      "incidents30Days": {
        "title": "Incidents (30 days)",
        "icon": "Alert",
        "description": "Number of incidents in the last 30 days",
        "target": "pagerdutyIncident",
        "calculationSpec": {
          "func": "count",
          "calculationBy": "entities",
          "filter": {
            "combinator": "and",
            "rules": [
              {
                "operator": ">=",
                "property": "created_at",
                "value": "{{(now - 2592000) | strftime(\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")}}"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "type": "number"
      },
      "incidents90Days": {
        "title": "Incidents (90 days)",
        "icon": "Alert",
        "description": "Number of incidents in the last 90 days",
        "target": "pagerdutyIncident",
        "calculationSpec": {
          "func": "count",
          "calculationBy": "entities",
          "filter": {
            "combinator": "and",
            "rules": [
              {
                "operator": ">=",
                "property": "created_at",
                "value": "{{(now - 7776000) | strftime(\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")}}"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "type": "number"
      }
    ```
    </details>

5. Click `Save` to update the blueprint.

:::info Understanding aggregation properties
Aggregation properties automatically count or aggregate data from related entities. In this case, they count PagerDuty incidents that are related to each service and filter them by creation date to get incident counts for the last 30 and 90 days.
:::

### Add MTBF calculation properties

Now we'll add calculation properties that use the aggregation properties to automatically compute MTBF metrics for each service:

1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.

2. Click on the **PagerDuty Service** blueprint.

3. Click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and choose `Edit JSON`.

4. Add these calculation properties to the blueprint JSON:
    <details>
    <summary><b>MTBF calculation properties (click to expand)</b></summary>

      ```json showLineNumbers
      "mtbf_30_days": {
        "title": "MTBF (30 days)",
        "icon": "ClockLoader",
        "description": "Mean Time Between Failures over the past 30 days (in hours)",
        "calculation": "if (.properties.incidents30Days // 0) > 0 then (30 * 24) / .properties.incidents30Days else null end",
        "type": "number"
        
      },
      "mtbf_90_days": {
        "title": "MTBF (90 days)",
        "icon": "ClockLoader", 
        "description": "Mean Time Between Failures over the past 90 days (in hours)",
        "calculation": "if (.properties.incidents90Days // 0) > 0 then (90 * 24) / .properties.incidents90Days else null end",
        "type": "number"
      }
      ```
   </details>

2. Click `Save` to update the blueprint.


### Add MTBF target and threshold properties

Before creating self-service actions, we need to add properties for storing MTBF targets and alert thresholds:

1. Still in the **PagerDuty Service** blueprint JSON, add these properties to the `properties` section:

    <details>
    <summary><b>MTBF target and threshold properties (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    "mtbfTarget": {
      "title": "MTBF Target (hours)",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Target mean time between failures in hours"
    },
    "mtbfCriticalThreshold": {
      "title": "Critical Threshold (%)",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Percentage below target that triggers critical alert",
      "default": 50
    },
    "mtbfWarningThreshold": {
      "title": "Warning Threshold (%)", 
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Percentage below target that triggers warning",
      "default": 75
    }
    ```
    </details>

2. Click `Save` to update the blueprint.



## Set up self-service actions

Now let's create self-service actions to help teams monitor and improve MTBF for their services.

<h3> Add Port secrets </h3>

<ExistingSecretsCallout integration="PagerDuty" />

First, add the required secrets to your portal:

1. Click on the `...` button in the top right corner of your Port application.

2. Click on **Credentials**.

3. Click on the `Secrets` tab.

4. Click on `+ Secret` and add the following secret:
   - `PAGERDUTY_API_KEY`: Your PagerDuty API token.



### Set reliability target action

Create an action to set MTBF targets for services:

1. Click on the `+ New Action` button.

2. Click on the `{...} Edit JSON` button.

3. Copy and paste the following JSON configuration:

    <details>
    <summary><b>Set reliability target action (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
      "identifier": "set_mtbf_target",
      "title": "Set MTBF Target", 
      "icon": "Pagerduty",
      "description": "Set reliability targets and thresholds for the service",
      "trigger": {
        "type": "self-service",
        "operation": "DAY-2",
        "userInputs": {
          "properties": {

            "mtbfCriticalThreshold": "{{.inputs.criticalThreshold}}",
            "mtbfWarningThreshold": "{{.inputs.warningThreshold}}"
          }
        }
      },
      "requiredApproval": false
    }
    ```
    </details>

4. Click `Save`.

## Create MTBF monitoring automation

<h3> Set up MTBF monitoring service </h3>

Before creating the automation, we need to set up a dedicated PagerDuty service to receive MTBF threshold breach alerts. This ensures all MTBF-related incidents are centrally managed and don't get mixed with incidents from the monitored services themselves.

Create a new PagerDuty service with the following details:
- **Name**: `MTBF Threshold Monitor`.
- **Description**: `Monitors MTBF thresholds across all services and alerts when targets are breached`.
- **Integration Type**: Events API v2.

:::tip Create PagerDuty service
If you need help creating a PagerDuty service, you can use Port's self-service action described in our [Create PagerDuty Service guide](/guides/all/create-pagerduty-service). This provides both webhook and GitHub workflow options for automated service creation.
:::

<h3> Add routing key to Port secrets </h3>

Once you've created your MTBF monitoring service, add its routing key to Port secrets:

1. In your PagerDuty service, go to the **Integrations** tab and copy the **Integration Key** (routing key).

2. In Port, click on the `...` button in the top right corner of your Port application.

3. Click on **Credentials**.

4. Click on the `Secrets` tab.

5. Click on `+ Secret` and add the following:
   - **Key**: `MONITORING_SVC_PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY`.
   - **Value**: Your MTBF monitoring service integration key (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd`).

6. Click `Save`.

<h3> Create the automation </h3>

Set up an automation to monitor MTBF thresholds and trigger alerts:

1. Head to the [automation](https://app.getport.io/settings/automations) page.

2. Click on the `+ Automation` button.

3. Copy and paste the following JSON configuration:

    <details>
    <summary><b>MTBF threshold monitoring automation (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
      "identifier": "mtbf_threshold_monitor",

        }
      },
      "publish": true
    }
    ```
    </details>

         {
           "property": "mtbf_30_days",
           "operator": "<",
           "value": 168
         },
         {
           "property": "incidents30Days",
           "operator": ">",
           "value": 5
         }
       ]
     }
   ```

6. Group table by `mtbfCriticalThreshold` property.

7. Click on the `Save` icon in the top right corner.

</details>

## Let's test it!

1. **Verify MTBF calculations:**
   - Navigate to your [PagerDuty Service catalog](https://app.getport.io/organization/catalog). 
   - Open any service and check that MTBF values are populated.
   - Verify the MTBF trend shows the correct status.

2. **Test the Generate MTBF Report action:**
   - Go to a service with incident history.
   - Click `Generate MTBF Report`.
   - Select a time range and execute the action.
   - Review the detailed service information returned.

3. **Set reliability targets:**
   - Click `Set MTBF Target` on a critical service.
   - Set an appropriate target (e.g., 168 hours for weekly failures).
   - Configure warning (75%) and critical (50%) thresholds.

4. **Monitor the dashboard:**
   - Open your **Service Reliability (MTBF) Monitoring** dashboard.
   - Review services requiring attention.
   - Check MTBF trends and target compliance.

## Best practices

- **Set realistic targets**: Base MTBF targets on historical performance and business requirements.
- **Monitor trends**: Focus on trend direction rather than absolute values - improving trends indicate better reliability.
- **Investigate degrading services**: Services with declining MTBF need immediate attention and investigation.
- **Regular review**: Schedule weekly reviews of MTBF metrics with engineering teams.
- **Combine with MTTR**: Use MTBF alongside MTTR metrics for comprehensive reliability monitoring.
