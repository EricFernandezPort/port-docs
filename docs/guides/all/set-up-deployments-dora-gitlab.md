# Set up deployments using GitLab merge requests or jobs

This guide adapts the [Create & track DORA metrics in your portal](/guides/all/create-and-track-dora-metrics-in-your-portal) guide by demonstrating how to define deployments in Port using GitLab's Merge Requests (MRs) and Jobs.
By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll be able to leverage DORA metrics using GitLab and gain accurate deployment insights in your portal. 

## Prerequisites

To set up GitLab merge requests or jobs for DORA metrics in your portal, you will need:

- Admin permissions (in order to install the experience and execute self-service actions).
- An installed DORA Metrics experience - based on this guide: [Create & track DORA metrics in your portal](/guides/all/create-and-track-dora-metrics-in-your-portal)
- An installed GitLab integration.


## Configure your deployments

1. **Map merge requests and/or jobs as deployments**
    - Go to the **Builder** -> **Data Sources** then click on the GitLab integration
    - Add a new mapping to ingest GitLab merge requests as deployment entities.

:::info Technical note: how deployments are mapped
Keep in mind that the mapping ingests the deployments into the `dora_deployment_event` blueprint, for further information visit [Create & track DORA metrics in your portal](/guides/all/create-and-track-dora-metrics-in-your-portal).
:::

    ```yaml showLineNumbers
    - kind: merge-request
      selector:
        query: 'true'
      port:
        entity:
          mappings:
            identifier: .id | tostring
            title: .title
            blueprint: '"dora_deployment_event"'
            properties:
              deployment_type: '"MR merged"'
              deployment_time: .merged_at
              leadTimeHours: >-
                (.created_at as $createdAt | .merged_at as $mergedAt | ($createdAt
                | sub("\\..*Z$"; "Z") | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | mktime)
                as $createdTimestamp | ($mergedAt | if . == null then null else
                sub("\\..*Z$"; "Z") | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | mktime end)
                as $mergedTimestamp | if $mergedTimestamp == null then null else
                (((($mergedTimestamp - $createdTimestamp) / 3600) * 100 | floor) /
                100) end)
    ```

    - Alternatively, map jobs as deployments:
    ```yaml showLineNumbers
      - kind: job
        selector:
        query: 'true'
        port:
        entity:
            mappings:
            identifier: .id | tostring
            title: .title // (.id | tostring)
            blueprint: '"dora_deployment_event"'
            properties:
                deployment_type: '"GitLab Job"'
                deployment_time: .finished_at
                status: .status
                leadTimeHours: >-
                (.commit.committed_date as $createdAt | .finished_at as $mergedAt |
                ($createdAt | sub("\\.\\d+(Z|\\+00:00)$"; "Z") | 
                strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | mktime) as $createdTimestamp | 
                ($mergedAt | if . == null then null else sub("\\.\\d+(Z|\\+00:00)$"; "Z")
                | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | mktime end) as $mergedTimestamp |
                if $mergedTimestamp == null then null else 
                (((($mergedTimestamp - $createdTimestamp) / 3600) * 100 | floor) / 100) end)
    ```

    - Save the mapping. Port will begin ingesting matching events as deployments.

2. **(Optional) Filtering or tagging**
    - You can include/exclude specific branches, labels, or repos in your mapping configuration.
    - Example: Only count deployments that their target branch is `main` and their state is `closed`.
        Using the query filter:
            ```yaml showLineNumbers
        query: ([.state == "closed"] | any) and ([.target_branch == "main"] | any)
        ```

3. **Test the configuration**
    - Trigger a new merge request and complete it, or run a deployment job.
    - In Port, navigate to the relevant deployment blueprint and verify the new deployment appears.


## Next steps

- View your DORA metrics in the dashboard for deployment insights once integration data is ingested.
- Set up incident tracking to enable full DORA coverage.
- Link deployments to teams or services for fine-grained metrics.
