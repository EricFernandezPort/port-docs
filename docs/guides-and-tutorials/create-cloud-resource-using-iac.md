# Create cloud resource using IaC

This guide takes 7 minutes to complete, and aims to demonstrate:

- A complete flow to create a resource using IaC.
- The simplicity of communicating with Port from a self-service action backend.

:::tip Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and a basic knowledge of working with Port. If you haven't done so, go ahead and complete the [quickstart](/quickstart).

- You will need a Github repository in which you can place a workflow that we will use in this guide. If you don't have one, we recommend [creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) named `Port-actions`.

:::

### The goal of this guide

In this guide we will open a pull-request in our Github repository from within Port to create a new cloud resource using gitops.

After completing it, you will get a sense of how your organization's daily routine could look like:

- Platform engineers will be able to define powerful actions that developers can use without unnecessary overhead.
- Developers will be able to easily create and track cloud resources from Port.
- R&D managers will get a bird's-eye-view of the cloud resources in the organization.

### Add an IaC URL to your services

In this guide we will add a new property to our `service` blueprint, which we can use to access the definition of its cloud resource.

1. Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model).
2. Click on your `service` blueprint, then click on `New property`.
3. Choose `URL` as the type, fill it like this and click `Save`:

<img src='/img/guides/iacPropertyForm.png' width='40%' />

This property is empty for now in all services, we will fill it as part of the action we're about to create üòé

### Setup the action's frontend

1. Head to the [Self-service tab](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) in your Port application, and click on `+ New action`.

2. Each action in Port is directly tied to a blueprint. Our action creates a resource for an existing `service` in our environment, so choose `Service` from the dropdown list.

3. Fill out the form like this and click `Next`:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionDetails.png' width='50%' />

<br/><br/>

4. We want our s3 bucket to be given a name and a public/private visibility. Click on `+ New input`, fill out the form like this and click `Create`:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionInputName.png' width='50%' />

<br/><br/>

5. Now let's create the visibility input. Click on `+ New input`, fill out the form like this and click `Create`:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionInputVisibility.png' width='50%' />

<br/><br/>

6. Now we'll define the backend of the action. Port supports multiple invocation types, for this tutorial we will use a `Github workflow`.
   - Replace the `Organization` and `Repository` values with your values (this is where the workflow will reside and run).
   - Name the workflow `portCreateBucket.yaml`.
   - Fill out the rest of the form like this, then click `Next`:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionBackend.png' width='75%' />

<br/><br/>

6. The last step is customizing the action's permissions. For simplicity's sake, we will use the default settings. For more information, see the [permissions](/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/) page. Click `Create`.

The action's frontend is now ready ü•≥

### Setup the action's backend

Now we want to write the logic that our action will trigger.

1. First, let's create the necessary token and secrets:

- Go to your [Github tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens), create a personal access token with `repo` scope, and copy it (this token is needed to create a pull-request from our workflow).

  <img src='/img/guides/personalAccessToken.png' width='80%' />

  - Go to your [Port application](https://app.getport.io/), hover over the `...` in the top right corner, then click `Credentials`. Copy your `Client ID` and `Client secret`.

2. In the repository where your workflow will reside, create 3 new secrets under `Settings->Secrets and variables->Actions`:

- `PAT` - the personal access token you created in the previous step.
- `PORT_CLIENT_ID` - the client ID you copied from your Port app.
- `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET` - the client secret you copied from your Port app.

<img src='/img/guides/iacRepositorySecrets.png' width='60%' />

4. We will now create a simple `.tf` file that will serve as a template for our new resource:

- In your Github repository, create a file named `cloudResource.tf` under `/templates/` (it's path should be `/templates/cloudResource.tf`).
- Copy the following snippet and paste it in the file's contents:
<details>
<summary><b>cloudResource.tf (click to expand)</b></summary>

```hcl
# cloudResource.tf

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
provider = aws.bucket_region
name = "{{ bucket_name }}"
acl = "{{ bucket_acl }}"
}
```

  </details>
  
5. Now let's create the workflow file that contains our logic. Our workflow will consist of 3 steps:
  - Create a copy of the template file and replace its variables with the data from the action's input.
  - Create a pull request in the repository to add the new resource.
  - Report & log the action result back to Port and update the relevant service's `IaC_file` property with the URL of the new resource file.

Under ".github/workflows", create a new file named `portCreateBucket.yaml` and use the following snippet as its content:

<details>
<summary><b>Github workflow (click to expand)</b></summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
name: Create cloud resource
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      name:
        type: string
      visibility:
        type: string
      port_payload:
        required: true
        description: Port's payload, including details for who triggered the action and general context
        type: string
jobs:
  createResource:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Copy template file
        run: |
          cp templates/cloudResource.tf resources/${{ inputs.name }}.tf
      - name: Update new file data
        run: |
          sed -i 's/{{ bucket_name }}/${{ inputs.name }}/' resources/${{ inputs.name }}.tf
          sed -i 's/{{ bucket_acl }}/${{ inputs.visibility }}/' resources/${{ inputs.name }}.tf
      - name: Open a pull request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          commit-message: Create new resource - ${{ inputs.name }}
          committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com>
          author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>
          signoff: false
          branch: new-resource-${{ inputs.name }}
          delete-branch: true
          title: Create new resource - ${{ inputs.name }}
          body: |
            Create new ${{ inputs.visibility }} resource - ${{ inputs.name }}
          draft: false
  updateEntity:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update Entity
        uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
        with:
          identifier: ${{fromJson(inputs.port_payload).context.entity}}
          blueprint: service
          properties: |-
            {
              "iac_file": "${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/resources/${{ inputs.name }}.tf"
            }
          clientId: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          operation: UPSERT
          runId: ${{fromJson(inputs.port_payload).context.runId}}
      - name: Create a log message
        uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
        with:
          clientId: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          operation: PATCH_RUN
          runId: ${{fromJson(inputs.port_payload).context.runId}}
          logMessage: Pull request created successfully for "${{ inputs.name }}" üöÄ
```

</details>

All done! The action is ready to be executed üöÄ

### Execute the action

After creating an action, it will appear under the `Self-service` tab of your Port application:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionAfterCreation.png' width='35%' />

1. Click on `Execute`.

2. Enter a name for your s3 bucket and choose a visibility, select any service from the list and click `Execute`. A small popup will appear, click on `View details`:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionExecutePopup.png' width='40%' />

3. This page provides details about the action run. We can see that the backend returned `Success` and the pull-request was created successfully:

<img src='/img/guides/iacActionRunAfterExecution.png' width='90%' />

#### Access the bucket's definition from Port

You may have noticed that even though we updated the service's IaC file URL, it still leads to a non-existent page. This is because our new resource does not exist in the repository yet, let's take care of that:

1. Merge the pull-request.
2. Go to the entity page of the service that you executed the action for:

<img src='/img/guides/iacEntityAfterAction.png' width='50%' />

3. Click on the IaC file link to access the definition of your new resource.

All done! You can now create resources for your services directly from Port üí™üèΩ

### Possible daily routine integrations

### Conclusion

Developer portals need to support and integrate with git-ops practices seamlessly. Developers should be able to perform routine tasks independantly, without having to create bottlenecks within the organization.  
With Port, platform engineers can design precise and flexible self-service actions for their developers, while integrating with many different backends to suit your specific needs.
