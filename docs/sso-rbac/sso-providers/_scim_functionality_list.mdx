<h3> Functionality enabled by SCIM </h3>

By enabling SCIM the following functionality will be enabled:

- Automatic deprovisioning of users (for example, when a user is unassigned from the SSO application, that user will automatically lose access to Port).

<h3> Limitations </h3>

- **Does not support user provisioning** - Only deprovisioning is supported; users must be created manually or through SSO login
- **Does not sync user attribute updates** - Changes to user profiles in your identity provider will not automatically update in Port
- **Does not support group provisioning** - Group membership changes in your identity provider are not synchronized via SCIM
- **Does not provide real-time sync** - SCIM operations may have delays and are not instantaneous
- **Does not support custom user attributes** - Only standard user fields are processed during deprovisioning
- **Only supported for customers with a single workspace** - SCIM is not available for multi-workspace setups

For full user and group synchronization, rely on the SSO login process rather than SCIM.
