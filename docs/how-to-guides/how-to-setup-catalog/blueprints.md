# Blueprints

## What is a blueprint?

Blueprints are the most basic building block in Port.

Modern infrastructure is composed of many moving parts. a blueprint represents every asset you manage, from `microservice` to `environments` of all kinds, `permissions`, `databases`, and more.

In this section you will:

1. **Map your software infrastructure** - to understand what blueprints you want to manage
2. **Create your blueprints** - including their properties
3. **View the results inside Port** - see the blueprints you created

:::tip
The most important thing to know about blueprints is that they are **completely customizable**, they will support any number of properties you choose, with every type you might need.

You can be as precise or as abstract as you want, and the best thing is you can always go back and update your blueprints as your infrastructure grows, and as your Developer Platform evolves.
:::

## Define your blueprints

There are a few important steps when trying to define your blueprints:

1. **Think about the Entities that you want to manage** - What will your organization benefit from? For example, in one organization, managing microservices (with clusters, deployments, etc...) is a big issue. In another, it could be understating what environments the organization has in a given moment.
2. **What properties characterize your entities** - For example, a microservice might have a link to the Github repository, the slack channel of the responsible team and a healthcheck status
3. **What are the relationships between the different entities** - For example, we would like to create a relation between microservices and deployments in order to track where each microservice is deployed

By the end of this section, you should have something like this in mind:

## Understanding the structure of a blueprint

The basic structure of a Blueprint request:

```json
{
    "identifier": "UniqueID",
    "title": "Title",
    "icon": "one of Airflow, Ansible, Argo, Aws, Azure, Blueprint, Bucket, Cloud, Cluster, CPU, Customer, Datadog, DefaultEntity, DefaultProperty, DeployedAt, Deployment, DevopsTool, Docs, Environment, Git, Github, GitVersion, GoogleCloud, GPU, Grafana, Jenkins, Lambda, Link, Lock, Microservice, Moon, Node, Okta, Package, Permission, Server, Service, Terraform",
    "dataSource": "Port",
    "formulaProperties": {},
    "schema": {
        "properties": {
            "foo": {
                "type": "string",
                "title": "Foo"
            },
            "bar": {
                "type": "number",
                "title": "Bar"
            },
            "date": {
                "type": "string",
                "format": "date-time",
                "title": "Date"
            }
        },
        "required": []
    }
}
```

Let's go over each field and explain its meaning:

- `identifier` - A unique identifier (Note that while the identifier is unique, it can be changed after creation)
- `title` - A nicely written name for the blueprint
- `icon` - An icon to visually distinguish from other blueprints, can be one of the following: `Airflow, Ansible, Argo, Aws, Azure, Blueprint, Bucket, Cloud, Cluster, CPU, Customer, Datadog, DefaultEntity, DefaultProperty, DeployedAt, Deployment, DevopsTool, Docs, Environment, Git, Github, GitVersion, GoogleCloud, GPU, Grafana, Jenkins, Lambda, Link, Lock, Microservice, Moon, Node, Okta, Package, Permission, Server, Service, Terraform`
- `dataSource` - The source entity data is ingested from for this Blueprint, can be either `Port` or `Github`
- `schema` - An object containing two more nested fields:
  - `properties` - An object containing a collection of type and format fields as shown in the Properties, types and formats document
  - `required` - An array of strings containing the name of properties that are mandatory in every entity created

:::note
All property fields are **Nullable** by default (`required=false`). So if you want to enforce a specific property, it needs to appear in the `required` array
:::

## Defining blueprint properties

Let's look at an example for a property definition:

```json
"string_prop": {
    "title": "String Property",
    "type": "string",
    "default": "foo",
    "description": "A string property"
}
```

Now let's look at the structure of this property definition and also explore the entire set of options for a single property:

- `title` - A nicely written name for the property
- `type` - The data type of the property, we will explore all available types in the [Blueprint Property Types](#blueprint-property-types) section
- `format` - A specific data format to pair with some of the available types, will be explored further in the [Blueprint Property Formats](#blueprint-property-formats) section
- `default` - A default value for this property in case an entity is created without explicitly providing a value
- `description` - A description for the property, this value is visible via in info node from the UI, and can help provide more information about the use of a property

![Property Description Label Example](../../../static/img/setup-your-port/self-service-portal/blueprints/propertyDescriptionLabelExample.png)

:::note
The only mandatory property field is `type`
:::

## Blueprint property types

The API supports the following **types**:

- `string` - Just a simple string - `"hello"`
- `number` - Numeric field (including integers, doubles, floats, etc...) - `1`, `2.3`, `5e3`,...
- `boolean` - `true`/ `false`
- `object` - A well formatted object (i.e. python dictionary, javascript object, JSON, etc...)
- `array` - A multi-element array - `[1,2,3]`, `["a","b","c"]`

## Property type examples

Here are examples for property definitions for all available types (remember that only the `type` field is mandatory):

### String

```json
{
    "title": "String Property",
    "type": "string",
    "description": "A string property",
    "default": "foo"
}
```

### Number

```json
{
    "title": "Number Property",
    "type": "number",
    "description": "A number property",
    "default": 42
}
```

### Boolean

```json
{
    "title": "Boolean Property",
    "type": "boolean",
    "description": "A boolean property",
    "default": True
}
```

### Object

```json
{
    "title": "Object Property",
    "type": "object",
    "description": "An object property",
    "default": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

### Array

```json
{
    "title": "Array Property",
    "type": "array",
    "description": "An array property",
    "default": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

## Blueprint property formats

The API supports the following **formats**:

- `url` - A formatted URL, for example `"https://getport.io"`
- `email` - A formatted Email, for example `"port@getport.io"`
- `date-time` - A formatted ISO string datetime, for example `"2022-04-18T11:44:15.345Z"`
- `ipv4` - A standard IPv4 address, for example `127.0.0.1`
- `ipv6` - A standard IPv6 address, for example `FE80:CD00:0A20:0CDE:1257:1C34:211E:729C`

:::note
The `format` field is only supported when the property `type` is `string`
:::

## Property format examples

Here are examples for property definitions for all available formats (remember that a `format` only works when `type="string"`):

### URL

```json
{
    "title": "URL Property",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "url",
    "description": "A URL property",
    "default": "https://getport.io"
}
```

### Email

```json
{
    "title": "Email Property",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "email",
    "description": "An Email property",
    "default": "mor@getport.io"
}
```

### Date Time

```json
{
    "title": "Datetime Property",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "date-time",
    "description": "A datetime property",
    "default": "2022-04-18T11:44:15.345Z"
}
```

### IPv4

```json
{
    "title": "IPv4 Property",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "ipv4",
    "description": "An IPv4 property",
    "default": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

### IPv6

```json
{
    "title": "IPv6 Property",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "ipv6",
    "description": "An IPv6 property",
    "default": "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000"
}
```

## Create blueprints

Let's see how we can use Port's API to create blueprints:

### Getting an API token

:::note
For this next part you will need your Port `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`
:::

In order to perform any action with Port's API, you first need an **access token**, here are some code examples from various languages

<Tabs groupId="code-examples" defaultValue="python" values={[
    {label: "Python", value: "python"},
    {label: "Javascript", value: "javascript"},
    {label: "cURL", value: "curl"}
]}>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
# Dependencies to install:
# $ python -m pip install requests

import requests

CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'

API_URL = 'https://api.getport.io/v0.1'

credentials = {'client_id': CLIENT_ID, 'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET}

token_response = requests.get(f'{API_URL}/auth/access_token', params=credentials)

access_token = token_response.json()['accessToken']

# You can now use the value in access_token when making further requests

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript
// Dependencies to install:
// $ npm install axios --save

const axios = require('axios').default;

const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
const CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET';

const API_URL = 'https://api.getport.io/v0.1';

const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/auth/access_token`, {
    params: {
        client_id: CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
});

const accessToken = response.data.accessToken;

// You can now use the value in accessToken when making further requests

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
# Dependencies to install:
# For apt:
# $ sudo apt-get install jq
# For yum:
# $ sudo yum install jq

access_token=$(curl --location --request GET "https://api.getport.io/v0.1/auth/access_token?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" | jq '.accessToken' | sed 's/"//g')

# The token will be available in the access_token variable
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Creating a blueprint

Let's create a basic Blueprint for a `Microservice` using the API, our Blueprint will include a **Slack Channel** and a **Repo URL**.

In order to interact with the Blueprints API our basic URL will be [https://api.getport.io/v0.1/blueprints](https://api.getport.io/v0.1/blueprints), and we will create the blueprint using a REST **POST** request.

:::note
Remember the **access token** we generated earlier, we will use it while making new requests to Port's API
:::


<Tabs groupId="code-examples" defaultValue="python" values={[
    {label: "Python", value: "python"},
    {label: "Javascript", value: "javascript"},
    {label: "cURL", value: "curl"}
]}>

<TabItem value="python">

```python
# Dependencies to install:
# $ python -m pip install requests

# the access_token variable should already have the token from the previous example

import requests

API_URL = 'https://api.getport.io/v0.1'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'
}

blueprint = {
    'identifier': 'microservice',
    'title': 'Microservice',
    'icon': 'Microservice',
    'formulaProperties': {},
    'schema': {
        'properties': {
            'slackChannel': {
                'type': 'string',
                'title': 'Slack Channel',
                'description': 'The channel of the microservice\'s maintainers'
            },
            'repoUrl': {
                'type': 'string',
                'format': 'url',
                'title': 'Repository URL',
                'description': 'A URL to the Git repository of the microservice'
            }
        },
        'required': ['repoUrl'],
    }
}

response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/blueprints', json=blueprint, headers=headers)

# response.json() contains the content of the resulting blueprint

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript
// Dependencies to install:
// $ npm install axios --save

// the accessToken variable should already have the token from the previous example 

const axios = require('axios').default;

const API_URL = 'https://api.getport.io/v0.1';

const config = {
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
		},
	};

	const blueprint = {
		identifier: 'microservice',
		title: 'Microservice',
		icon: 'Microservice',
        formulaProperties: {},
		schema: {
			properties: {
				slackChannel: {
					type: 'string',
					title: 'Slack Channel',
					description: "The channel of the microservice's maintainers",
				},
				repoUrl: {
					type: 'string',
					format: 'url',
					title: 'Repository URL',
					description: 'A URL to the Git repository of the microservice',
				},
			},
			required: ['repoUrl'],
		},
	};

	const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/blueprints`, blueprint, config);

    // response.data contains the content of the resulting blueprint

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
# the access_token variable should already have the token from the previous example

curl --location --request POST "https://api.getport.io/v0.1/blueprints" \
	--header "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" \
	--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
	--data-raw "{
    \"identifier\": \"microservice\",
    \"title\": \"Microservice\",
    \"icon\": \"Microservice\",
    \"formulaProperties\": {},
    \"schema\": {
        \"properties\": {
            \"slackChannel\": {
                \"type\": \"string\",
                \"title\": \"Slack Channel\",
                \"description\": \"The channel of the microservice's maintainers\"
            },
            \"repoUrl\": {
                \"type\": \"string\",
                \"format\": \"url\",
                \"title\": \"Repository URL\",
                \"description\": \"A URL to the Git repository of the microservice\"
            }
        },
        \"required\": [\"repoUrl\"]
    }
}"

# The output of the command contains the content of the resulting blueprint
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You should now have a blueprint in the Blueprints Graph that looks like this:

![Example microservice blueprint](../../../static/img/setup-your-port/self-service-portal/blueprints/exampleMicroserviceBlueprint.png)

## Updating blueprints

You can always change the blueprint, add/remove properties or change existing property types as necessary.

In order to update a blueprint you can:

- Click the Pencil icon in the Blueprints Graph
- Make a REST PUT request to the URL `https://api.getport.io/v0.1/{blueprint_identifier}`
- Make a REST PATCH request to the URL `https://api.getport.io/v0.1/{blueprint_identifier}`

![Blueprints Graph edit button marked](../../../static/img/setup-your-port/self-service-portal/blueprints/blueprintGraphEditButtonMarked.png)

A PUT request has the exact same body as a POST request, it will simply overwrite the blueprint with the new data provided

A PATCH request has a more specific format that allows for precise changes in an existing blueprint, let's look at an example:

If we want to add a property called `Is Deployed?` with the `boolean` type, our PATCH request body will look like this:

```json
{
    "type": "setSchemaProperty",
    "propertyName": "isdeployed",
    "definition": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "title": "Is Deployed?",
    }
}
```

For more information about the PATCH request format, refer to the [API Reference](https://app.getport.io/Api-docs)


:::info A note about mirror properties
If you try to update a blueprint that has a [relation](relations), you will notice that its JSON body contains a key called `mirrorProperties`:

```json
"mirrorProperties": {
    "microservice": {
        "path": "package-microservice.$identifier"
    }
}
```

We will explore Mirror Properties further in a dedicated section, but for now just know that any edits to a blueprint should leave the objects that have `.$identifier` in their path property intact

:::

## Deleting blueprints

:::danger
A blueprint cannot be restored after deletion!
:::

In order to delete a blueprint you can:

- Click on the trash can icon in the specific blueprint node in the Blueprints Graph
- Make a REST DELETE request to the URL `https://api.getport.io/v0.1/{blueprint_identifier}`

![Blueprints Graph delete button marked](../../../static/img/setup-your-port/self-service-portal/blueprints/blueprintGraphDeleteButtonMarked.png)

## Next steps

Now that we understand **Blueprints**, we can start to model separate entities in our infrastructure!

In the next section we will talk about **Relations**, relations are a connection between two blueprints, and they will help us go from separate entities to a connected infrastructure map.

As preparation for the relations section, let's create a blueprint for `Package` to go with the `Microservice` blueprint we created earlier:

You can create the new blueprint from the UI (using the `New Blueprint` button in the Blueprints Graph) or from the API, the body of the request for the new blueprint should be:

```json
{
    "identifier": "package",
    "title": "Package",
    "icon": "Package",
    "formulaProperties": {},
    "schema": {
        "properties": {
            "version": {
                "title": "Version",
                "type": "number",
                "default": "1.0.0"
            },
            "inhouse": {
                "title": "In House?",
                "type": "boolean"
            }
        },
        "required": []
    },
    "dataSource": "Port"
}
```

At the end of this section, your Blueprints Graph should include the two blueprints shown below:

![graph package microservice](../../../static/img/setup-your-port/self-service-portal/blueprints/graphPackageMicroservice.png)
