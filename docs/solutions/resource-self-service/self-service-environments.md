# Self-Service Environments

Automating the creation of development environments is crucial for engineering teams. Manual setup is slow, error-prone, and often leads to inconsistencies that can delay development and cause integration headaches. By enabling self-service environment provisioning, teams can spin up the resources they need—on demand and with the right guardrails—freeing up developers to focus on building features instead of wrangling infrastructure.
