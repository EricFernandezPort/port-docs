# Detect, Diagnose and Trigger: Unify Alerts, Enrich with Context and Automate Creation

Modern incident management is broken. Too many tools, too many silos, and not enough context. At Port, we believe incident management should be unified, contextual, and automated—so teams can focus on resolution, not wrangling alerts.

## Why Incident Management Needs to Change

Traditional incident management is reactive and fragmented. Alerts come from everywhere, context is missing, and manual processes slow everything down. This leads to longer outages, frustrated teams, and unhappy users.

## The Port Approach: Unify, Enrich, Automate

There's a better way:

1. **Unify Alerts**: Bring all your alerts into a single, actionable stream.
2. **Enrich with Context**: Automatically add relevant metadata, ownership, and dependencies to every incident.
3. **Automate Creation**: Trigger incident workflows, notifications, and remediation steps—no manual handoffs.

## How to Put This Into Practice

### Unify Alerts

Connect all your monitoring and alerting tools to Port. Our integrations make it easy to centralize alerts from sources like Datadog, PagerDuty, and more.

- [Prometheus](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/webhook/examples/prometheus)
- [Grafana](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/webhook/examples/grafana)

### Enrich with Context

Every alert in Port is automatically enriched with context of all the related data: who owns the service, what dependencies are involved, and recent changes. This means faster diagnosis and fewer escalations.

Teams that have rich context on incidents resolve them up to 40% faster. Make sure your catalog is up to date!

### Automate Creation

Don't just detect—act. With Port, you can trigger incident creation, notifications, and even remediation workflows automatically, based on alert conditions.

## Real-World Benefits

- **Faster resolution**: Less time spent gathering info, more time fixing problems.
- **Fewer escalations**: The right people are looped in, with the right context, from the start.
- **Happier teams**: No more alert fatigue or context switching.
