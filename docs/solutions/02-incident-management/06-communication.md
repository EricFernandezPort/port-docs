# Keep Everyone in the Loop: Communicate Internally and Externally

Great incident response is as much about communication as it is about investigation or remediation. The best teams keep everyone aligned-engineers, stakeholders, and customers—by making communication a first-class part of their incident management process.

## Why Communication Matters

In high-pressure moments, clear and timely communication prevents confusion, builds trust, and accelerates resolution. Silence or scattered updates can make a bad situation worse.
