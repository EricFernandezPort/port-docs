# Automate Incident Start: Kick it off Right

When incidents happen, speed and clarity matter. But when your alerts are scattered across tools and workflows for managing an incident's lifecycle are fragmented, even simple incidents can spiral into slow, chaotic responses.

This solution page, will show you how to automate the response to all your signals, take ownership faster, and close incidents with confidence.

## Why Automate Incident Start?

Manual incident creation is slow, error-prone, and easy to forget—especially when alerts are flying in from every direction. Automation ensures:

- **No incident is missed**: Every critical signal becomes actionable
- **Faster response**: Incidents are created instantly, not after minutes of confusion
- **Less manual work**: Engineers focus on resolution, not paperwork

## How Port Enables Automated Incident Creation

Port connects to all your alert sources—APM, monitoring, cloud, and more. With blueprints and automations, you can:

- Ingest alerts from any tool (Prometheus, Datadog, Dynatrace, etc.)
- Automatically trigger incident creation based on alert conditions
- Enrich every incident with context: affected services, owners, recent changes, and more
- Kick off workflows, notifications, and even remediation steps—no manual handoffs

## Step-by-Step: Set Up Automated Incident Start

### 1. Connect Your Alert Sources
Centralize all your signals in Port.
- [Connect Tools](../../getting-started/connect-tools.md)

### 2. Map Alerts to Incidents
Use blueprints and integrations to ensure every alert can trigger an incident.
- [Prometheus Integration](../../build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/webhook/examples/prometheus.md)
- [Datadog Monitors](../../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/apm-alerting/datadog/examples.md)
- [Dynatrace Problems](../../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/apm-alerting/dynatrace)
- [New Relic Issues](../../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/apm-alerting/newrelic.md)

### 3. Automate Incident Creation
Set up automations to create incidents, notify responders, and start workflows.
- [Automate Incident Workflows](../../actions-and-automations/actions-and-automations.md)

:::tip Review Your Automation Rules
Automate what matters, but avoid alert fatigue. Regularly review your automation rules to ensure only actionable signals trigger incidents.

## Real-World Benefits
- **Faster response**: Incidents are created the moment a signal fires
- **Fewer missed incidents**: No more relying on manual triage
- **More focus on resolution**: Engineers spend time fixing, not creating tickets
