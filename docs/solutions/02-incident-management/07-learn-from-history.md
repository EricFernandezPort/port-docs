# Learn from Every Incident: Build a Culture of Continuous Improvement

Every incident is an opportunity to learn and grow. Learning from history—through postmortems, RCAs, and data-driven insights—is the secret to building resilient systems and high-performing teams. But with the right tooling, the lessons from the past are not left there - they are indexed and available in each incident to come.

## Why Learning from Incidents Matters

Incidents are inevitable, but repeated mistakes don't have to be. Teams that invest in learning:
- Prevent future outages by addressing root causes
- Improve processes and automations
- Build trust and psychological safety in your tea
