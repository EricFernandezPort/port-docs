# Resilience by Design: Prevent and Minimize Your Incidents

Incidents are inevitable, but downtime and chaos don't have to be. Resilience is built, not wished for. The best teams prepare, automate, and learn, so when incidents happen, they're ready to bounce back fast.

## Why Resilience Matters

Modern systems are complex. Outages, misconfigurations, and human error are facts of life. The difference between high-performing teams and those that lose trust with their customers? Resilience: the ability to prevent incidents, and to recover quickly when they do occur.

## Readiness = Prepare + Automate + Learn

We think resilience is an evergreen initiative, an elusive and unreachable target and not a one-time project. Our most successful customers focus on a 3 part cycle, in which one:

1. **Prepares**: Map your systems, dependencies, and ownership so you know what's important, long before the first incident strikes. Build a meaningful catalog, to assist your human and AI incident responders.
2. **Automates**: Set up proactive checks, alerts, and self-healing workflows. Empower your human and AI incident responders to self-serve their way through investigation, remediation and communication around the incident, without need for tickets or approvals.
3. **Learns**: Capture incident data and feed it back into your processes for continuous improvement. The best teams generate their retrospective documentation and index it to prevent lengthy recurreces of the same incidents (greatly decreasing Mean Time to Resolution). Chase remediation tasks and improve the resilience of the system for a meaningful change to SLOs and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure)

A focus on learning from the past and a culture of continuous improvement can switch your teams from being reactive and overburdened to proactive and confident.

## How to Build Resilience with Port

### Prepare: Map Your World

A clear, up-to-date software catalog is the foundation of resilience. Know what you have, who owns it, and how everything connects.

### Automate: Proactive Checks and Self-Healing

Don't wait for things to break. Use Port to automate health checks, enforce best practices, and trigger remediation workflows before users are impacted.

:::caution Don't skip ownership
Resilience depends on clear ownership. Make sure every service and component in your catalog has an ownerâ€”otherwise, incidents will fall through the cracks.

### Learn: Close the Loop

After every incident, use Port to capture what happened, analyze root causes, and update your processes. Continuous learning is the secret to long-term resilience.

## Real-World Benefits

- **Fewer incidents**: Proactive checks and clear ownership prevent problems before they start.
- **Faster recovery**: When incidents do happen, you know exactly who to call and what to fix.
- **Continuous improvement**: Every incident makes your system stronger.
