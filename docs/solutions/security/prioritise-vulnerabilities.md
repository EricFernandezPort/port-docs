# Prioritize vulnerabilities

The harsh reality of modern application security is that you can't fix everything at once. Every day, new vulnerabilities are discovered, scanners flag thousands of potential issues, and security teams struggle to decide what deserves immediate attention versus what can wait. The traditional approach—treating all "critical" vulnerabilities equally—leads to analyst burnout and important issues slipping through the cracks.

## Why most vulnerability prioritization fails

Most organizations approach vulnerability management backward. They start with the vulnerability (usually sorted by CVSS score) and then try to figure out if it matters. This leads to:

- **Alert fatigue**: Security teams spend hours investigating vulnerabilities in deprecated services
- **Misaligned priorities**: Developers receive urgent tickets for issues that don't impact production
- **Resource waste**: Critical business services remain vulnerable while teams chase phantom threats
- **Missed context**: High-severity vulnerabilities in low-risk environments get the same attention as exploitable issues in customer-facing systems

## The Port approach: business context first

Port flips the traditional model by starting with business context and working backward to prioritization. Every vulnerability is automatically enriched with:

### Service context and mapping

Understanding which services are actually critical to your business is the foundation of intelligent prioritization. Port's software catalog provides this context automatically:

- **Service criticality**: Customer-facing payment services get different treatment than internal development tools
- **Ownership mapping**: Every vulnerability is instantly routed to the right team with full context
- **Dependency relationships**: Understand cascade effects before they impact production
- **Environment classification**: Production vulnerabilities are prioritized over development environment issues

### Real-time business impact assessment

Port connects security findings to business metrics that matter:

- **Customer exposure**: Which vulnerabilities affect services that handle customer data or payments?
- **Revenue impact**: What's the potential business cost if this vulnerability is exploited?
- **Compliance requirements**: Which findings affect services subject to regulatory requirements?
- **Recent changes**: Has this service been modified recently, increasing risk?

:::tip Start with what matters most
Instead of asking "How severe is this vulnerability?", ask "How critical is this service to our business?" The vulnerability management follows naturally from there.

## All business context lives in Port

The key to effective vulnerability prioritization is having all your business context in one place. Port's software catalog becomes the single source of truth for:

### Service ownership and contact information
- **Clear ownership**: Every service has designated owners who understand the business impact
- **Escalation paths**: Automated routing ensures critical issues reach the right people immediately
- **Team structures**: Understand which teams have capacity to address security issues

### Service classification and criticality
- **Business impact levels**: Revenue-generating, customer-facing, internal tools, development utilities
- **Data sensitivity**: Services handling PII, payment data, or other sensitive information
- **Compliance scope**: Services subject to SOX, PCI, HIPAA, or other regulatory requirements
- **Customer tiers**: Different treatment for vulnerabilities affecting enterprise vs. free-tier customers

### Technical architecture and dependencies
- **Service relationships**: Understand which vulnerabilities could cascade across systems
- **Technology stack**: Prioritize based on exploitability and exposure patterns
- **Network exposure**: Internet-facing services get different treatment than internal components
- **Authentication boundaries**: Services behind authentication have different risk profiles

## How to implement intelligent vulnerability prioritization

### Start by enriching your software catalog

Before you can prioritize effectively, ensure your software catalog contains the business context needed for intelligent decision-making:

[Build your software catalog](/getting-started/overview) with rich metadata about service criticality, ownership, and dependencies.

### Connect your security tools

Port integrates with leading security tools to automatically enrich findings with business context:

- [Visualize Wiz vulnerabilities](/guides/all/visualize-your-wiz-vulnerabilities/) - See Wiz findings enriched with service context and ownership
- [Visualize GitHub Dependabot alerts](/guides/all/visualize-your-github-dependabot-alerts/) - Connect dependency vulnerabilities to impacted services
- [Track security configurations](/guides/all/visualize-your-aws-storage-configuration/) - Monitor AWS storage security with business impact context

### Implement risk-based scoring

Traditional CVSS scoring doesn't consider your specific business context. Port enables risk-based scoring that factors in:

1. **Exploitability in your environment**: Is the vulnerable service actually reachable?
2. **Business criticality**: Revenue impact if this service is compromised
3. **Data sensitivity**: Types of data handled by the affected service
4. **Compliance implications**: Regulatory requirements for the affected service
5. **Remediation complexity**: How difficult and risky is it to fix this issue?

## Put prioritization into practice

### Automated triage workflows

Set up automated rules that route vulnerabilities based on business context:

- High-severity vulnerabilities in customer-facing services → immediate escalation
- Medium-severity findings in internal tools → standard team queue
- Low-severity issues in development environments → batch processing during maintenance windows

### Context-aware notifications

Instead of generic security alerts, send notifications with full business context:

- "Critical vulnerability detected in payment processing service (affects 50k customers)"
- "High-severity finding in internal tooling (no customer impact, non-urgent)"
- "Compliance-related vulnerability in SOX-scoped financial reporting service"

### Risk-based SLAs

Implement different response times based on actual business risk:

- **Critical business services**: 2-hour response time for high-severity vulnerabilities  
- **Customer-facing services**: 24-hour response for medium-severity findings
- **Internal tools**: 1-week response for non-critical vulnerabilities
- **Development environments**: Address during regular maintenance windows

:::caution Don't ignore the fundamentals
While business context is crucial for prioritization, never ignore basic security hygiene. Use Port's scorecards to ensure all services meet minimum security standards regardless of business criticality.

## Real-world benefits

Organizations using Port's business-context approach to vulnerability prioritization see:

- **Reduction in security analyst time** spent investigating irrelevant alerts
- **Faster mean time to remediation** for truly critical vulnerabilities
- **Improved developer satisfaction** through context-rich, actionable security findings
- **Better business alignment** between security and product teams
- **Reduced alert fatigue** leading to higher-quality security analysis

By connecting vulnerability data to business context, Port transforms security from a compliance burden into a strategic capability that protects what matters most while enabling developer productivity.
