# Security

## Why manage security using a developer portal?

Security teams are drowning in noise. Traditional Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) tools generate thousands of alerts, vulnerability scanners flag every potential issue, and compliance dashboards show red across the board. Meanwhile, developers receive security findings with zero context about business impact, criticality, or ownership. The result? Alert fatigue, ignored vulnerabilities, and a growing disconnect between security teams and the engineers who need to fix the issues.

You know the drill: it's Thursday afternoon, and you're staring at yet another CSV export of 15,000 "critical" vulnerabilities. The CISO wants a status update by end of day, but you have no idea which of these actually matter to the business. Half the alerts are for services that were deprecated months ago, a quarter are for libraries used in development environments, and the remaining vulnerabilities are scattered across dozens of repositories with no clear ownership.

This is where most security programs get stuck—in a cycle of prioritizing everything (which means prioritizing nothing) and burning out both security teams and developers with endless streams of context-free alerts.

## How can Port help?

Port transforms security from a compliance checkbox into a strategic enabler by bringing business context, ownership, and intelligence to every security decision. Here's how:

- **Vulnerability management with business context**: Go beyond traditional vulnerability management by connecting security findings to business context, ownership, and real-world impact. Every alert comes with the context needed to make informed decisions.
- **Intelligent vulnerability prioritization**: Leverage Port's rich software catalog to automatically prioritize vulnerabilities based on service criticality, customer impact, ownership, and recent changes.
- **Executive-ready security metrics**: Transform raw security data into meaningful dashboards that tell a story—showing trends, progress, and areas of concern that actually matter to business leaders.
- **Security champions at scale**: Empower teams with scorecards and initiatives that make security everyone's responsibility, not just the security team's problem.
- **Automated security workflows**: Streamline common security tasks like triaging vulnerabilities, creating exceptions, escalating critical issues, and keeping stakeholders informed.

## Port's approach to security

Security isn't a destination—it's a journey of continuous improvement. The best security programs we see focus on three core principles:

### 1. Context over quantity

Traditional security tools flood teams with alerts. Port flips this model by providing context-rich insights. Instead of showing 10,000 vulnerabilities, we show you the 50 that actually impact critical business services, complete with ownership information, recent changes, and business impact assessment.

### 2. Shift left, but don't ignore right

While everyone talks about shifting security left, the reality is that vulnerabilities will always exist in production. Port helps you manage the entire security lifecycle—from preventing issues during development to rapidly triaging and remediating issues in production.

### 3. Make security everyone's job

The most successful security programs don't rely on a central security team to fix everything. They empower developers, platform engineers, and product teams with the context and tools they need to make secure decisions autonomously.

## Beyond traditional vulnerability management

Traditional ASPM tools treat all vulnerabilities equally and lack business context. Port's approach to Context changes the game by:

- **Business context integration**: Every security finding is automatically enriched with information about service criticality, ownership, customer impact, and recent changes.
- **Intelligent risk assessment**: Risk scores consider not just CVSS ratings, but also exposure, business criticality, and exploitability in your specific environment.
- **Actionable remediation**: Security findings come with clear ownership, remediation guidance, and the ability to take action directly from the portal.

:::tip Context is everything in security
A critical vulnerability in a deprecated internal tool is very different from the same vulnerability in your customer-facing payment service. Port ensures you always have this context.

The traditional security model assumes that security teams have infinite time to investigate every alert and that developers have perfect knowledge of security best practices. Port's Context approach recognizes that neither is true and builds workflows that work for how organizations actually operate.

## What you'll learn in this solution

This solution guide covers the essential components of building a modern, context-aware security program:

1. **[Prioritize vulnerabilities](/solutions/security/prioritise-vulnerabilities)**: Learn how to cut through the noise by leveraging business context, service criticality, and ownership information to focus on what actually matters.

2. **[Security metrics visualization](/solutions/security/security-metrics-visualization)**: Discover how to create executive-ready dashboards that show security posture, trends, and progress in terms that business leaders understand.

3. **[Security champions & initiatives](/solutions/security/security-champions-initiatives)**: Build a culture of security across your organization with scorecards, guardrails, and initiatives that make secure practices the easy choice.

4. **[Security actions & automations](/solutions/security/security-actions-automations)**: Streamline security workflows with automated triage, intelligent exception handling, escalation workflows, and stakeholder communication.

By the end of this solution, you'll have transformed your security program from a reactive, alert-driven process into a proactive, business-aligned capability that enables developers while protecting what matters most.
