# Further engineering metrics

One of the key advantages of Port's flexible data model is the ability to measure arbitrary engineering metrics that matter to your organization, regardless of your engineering platform's architecture or version. 

Port can normalize and connect data from across your entire engineering ecosystem. This enables tracking of custom metrics that matter specifically to your organization - whether that's measuring cross-team dependencies, tracking technical debt across multiple repositories, or analyzing the impact of architectural decisions on delivery speed. The managed relations between entities allow for multi-dimensional analysis, helping you understand not just what's happening, but where and why. For example, you could analyze deployment frequency not just by team, but by service type, technology stack, or business domain. This deeper insight helps engineering leaders make more informed decisions about where to focus improvement efforts.

## Track developer onboarding, PR and build pipeline metrics from Github

Port integrates seamlessly with GitHub to track key engineering metrics like time-to-tenth-PR for new developers, PR review cycles, and build pipeline performance.
