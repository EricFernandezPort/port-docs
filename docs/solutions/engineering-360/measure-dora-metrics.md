# Measure DORA metrics

## Overview

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics are four key measurements that indicate the performance of software development teams: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Mean Time to Recovery, and Change Failure Rate. Organizations value these metrics because they provide clear, data-driven insights into their software delivery performance. By tracking DORA metrics, companies can benchmark their performance against industry standards, identify bottlenecks in their development pipeline, and make targeted improvements to their development processes that directly impact business outcomes.
