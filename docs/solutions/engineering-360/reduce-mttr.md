# Reduce MTTR

Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) measures how quickly teams can restore service after an incident. A low MTTR indicates strong operational resilience and effective incident response processes. By optimizing MTTR, organizations minimize service disruptions and maintain high availability for their users.

MTTR is influenced by several factors including incident detection time, diagnosis time and resolution time. Let's explore how a developer portal can help improve each of these areas.

Remember, the best solution is to prevent and reduce the impact of incidents. Take a look at our [incident management](/solutions/incident-management/prevent-and-minimize-incidents) solution for more information.

## Improve incident detection

The faster an incident is detected, the sooner teams can begin working on resolution.  
Port can help streamline incident detection in several ways:

- [Create JIRA issue from a NewRelic alert](/guides/all/create-jira-issue-from-newrelic/)
- [Create a Pagerduty incident from a NewRelic alert](/guides/all/create-pagerduty-incident-from-newrelic-alert/)

Take a look at our [incident management solution](/solutions/incident-management/detect-and-diagnose-incidents), where we cover detection in detail.

## Improve incident diagnosis and resolution

The faster your incident management team can access all the required data and diagnose a root cause, the sooner the incident can be resolved.

By speeding up access to tools for privileged access to data or systems, or to take actions to address infrastructure issue - the incident can be resolved without lengthy approval bottlenecks.
