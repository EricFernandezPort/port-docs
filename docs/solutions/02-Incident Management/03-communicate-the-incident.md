# Communicate the Incident

Once an incident is identified, the next critical task isn’t investigation — it’s communication.

In high-pressure moments, poor communication causes more damage than the incident itself. That's why Port doesn’t just help you manage the lifecycle of an incident—it gives you the tools to communicate around it effectively.

Let’s break that down into the three main needs every incident demands:

1. A space for collaboration around the investigation
1. Internal announcements
1. External annoucements

## 1. A space for collaboration

Every incident needs a war room—a place where engineers, responders, and stakeholders can coordinate in real time.

Port helps you with creating that space, as well as reflecting all relevant findings and state back to the incident entity.
This doesn't just save you time in creating slack channels, or meeting bridges - the goal is to create a space where you can focus on investigation, and all tracking for the purposes of creating an RCA, or proposing updates for internal and external communications are handled automatically for you.

Guides:

- [Create Slack Channel](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/create-slack-channel-for-reported-incident) automation, to create a new slack channel off the back of a new incident
- [Create Zoom Bridge](#) automation, to open a new bridge and send to your new slack channel
- [Incident Notetaker Agent](#) to enrich your incident with:
    - Add updates, findings, and workarounds as structured notes or timeline entries
    - Tag relevant services or owners for visibility
    - Link to logs, traces, or dashboards right in the incident context


## 2. Internal announcements

Not everyone will be fixing the incident—but many need to be aware of it. Complicating matters is the varied audience. A technical announcement centred around services and metrics are not going to serve your Sales teams, from those responsible for existing customers, through those trying to close new business.

Port helps you broadcast internal status updates quickly and consistently:

- [Internal Incident Communicator Agent](#) to summarise updates around your incident to different internal slack channels
- [Incident Update Slack Notifications](#) to send concise notificaitons as incidents change status

Push updates to Slack or email directly from the incident

## 3. External communication

Often incidents impact your customers, either in performance degradation, logical bugs or availability issues. In those moments, clear external communication builds trust, and unclear or a lack of communication quickly erodes it.

Port makes it easy to:

- [Publish status page updates directly from the incident](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/manage-statuspage-incident)
- [Keep a record of what was communicated, when, and by whom](#)

Because everything happens in one place, your external messaging stays accurate—and you’re not scrambling to assemble a picture from scattered tools.
