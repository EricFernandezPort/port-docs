# Operate & resolve incidents

When incidents strike, the best teams don't just react—they operate with speed, clarity, and confidence. At Port, we believe that incident response should empower engineers to take decisive action, automate away friction, and keep everyone in the loop—all from a single, unified portal.

## Why real-time action matters

Every minute counts during an incident. The longer it takes to acknowledge, escalate, or resolve, the greater the impact on your users and your business. Our most successful customers give their engineers the tools and context to:

- **Acknowledge and take ownership** of incidents instantly
- **Escalate or reassign** when more help is needed
- **Grant temporary permissions** to unblock responders
- **Update stakeholders and status pages** with a click
- **Resolve and close out** incidents, all in one place

## How Port enables best-in-class incident operations

Port brings all your incident actions together, so you can:

- See every incident in context—owners, impacted services, recent changes, and more
- Take action directly from the incident view, with no tab-switching or manual handoffs
- Automate repetitive tasks and approvals, so engineers can focus on resolution

## Step-by-step: what great teams do in Port

### 1. Manage the full incident lifecycle centrally

Take ownership or hand off to the right responder, fast.
- [Acknowledge Incident](../../guides/all/acknowledge-incident)
- [Change PagerDuty Incident Owner](../../guides/all/change-pagerduty-incident-owner)

Loop in additional teams or leadership with a single action.
- [Escalate an Incident](/guides/all/escalate-an-incident)

Wrap up the incident, document what happened, and return to normal.
- [Resolve Incident](/guides/all/resolve-incident)
- [Delete a ServiceNow Incident](/guides/all/delete-servicenow-incident/)

### 2. Grant temporary permissions

Unblock engineers by granting just-in-time access to the systems and data they need to investigate the incident.

- [Automatically Approve Actions](/guides/all/automatically-approve-action-using-automation/)


:::tip Act Fast, But With Context
The best responders move quickly—but never blindly. Use Port's strong RBAC, self-service and dynamic permissions to enable your incident to gain appropriate access and take actions quickly.
