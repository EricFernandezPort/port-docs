# Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the Port MCP Server, expand a section below:

<details>
<summary>How can I connect to the MCP?</summary>
Make sure you're using the correct regional URL for your organization and have followed the setup instructions for your client (Cursor, VSCode, Claude).
</details>

<details>
<summary>I completed the connection but nothing happens</summary>
Ensure you authenticated successfully and have sufficient permissions. If problems persist, contact Port support.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do I see an error about too many tools?</summary>
Each self-service action becomes its own tool. If you have many actions, models may hit tool-count limits. Disable non-essential tools or ask an admin to review actions.
</details>
