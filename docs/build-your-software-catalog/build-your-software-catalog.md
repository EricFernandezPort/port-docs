# Build your Software Catalog

Port's Software Catalog provides a flexible and customizable solution for you to reflect your unique Software Development Life Cycle in a centralized catalog.

With simple building blocks, the software catalog can be tailored to your data model, enabling it to accurately reflect your processes and requirements.

## Step 1 - Define your data model

Defining the structure of your data model is the first step in using Port's Software Catalog. This step involves determining what information should be included in the catalog and how it should be organized.

With Port's Software Catalog, your data model can be defined using a database-like definition, allowing for a clear and organized representation of your SDLC.

By defining the structure of your data model in this way, you can ensure that the software catalog accurately reflects your processes and is set up to meet your specific needs.

## Step 2 - Sync data to catalog

The next step in using Port's Software Catalog is to sync data into the catalog. This involves collecting information from various sources and integrating it into the catalog.

Port's Software Catalog provides integrations to collect data that may be siloed across your devOps architecture, making it easy to centralize all relevant information in one place.

By syncing data into the software catalog, you can ensure that you have a comprehensive and up-to-date view of your SDLC.
