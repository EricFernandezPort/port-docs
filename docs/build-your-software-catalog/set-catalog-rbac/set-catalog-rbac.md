# Set Catalog RBAC üîê

Port provides granular control to make sure every user sees only the parts of the catalog that are relevant for him.

## Use cases üí°

The catalog RBAC allows admins to finely control which users have access to which information from the catalog, for example:

- Show a developer only the services that he owns;
- Allow a user to edit just a specific property on an entity;
- Create a fully read-only view for a developer;
- etc.

## Examples

Refer to the [examples](./examples.md) page for practical examples of Port's RBAC.

## UI behavior

Configuring user permissions is reflected in Port's UI. The UI also includes indication messages when trying to perform changes. For example:

The `register` and `unregister` buttons will be disabled in the UI, in accordance with the blueprint permissions (unauthorized users/groups will not be able to register or unregister entities).

![Create button disabled without permissions](../../../static/img/software-catalog/role-based-access-control/permissions/memberNoCreatePermission.png)

The `edit property` button will be disabled according to the permissions:

Immutable properties (restricted properties) will be hidden from users when modifying entities.
