## Metrics and Sync Status

There are two main ways to view metrics and monitor the sync status:

- **Sync Status Tab**  
    Navigate to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page, under the `Exporters` section, select your integration.  
    In the `Sync Status` tab, you will find information regarding the sync status and other metrics.
    Note: The same data is also available through the [Get an integration's metrics and sync status](https://docs.port.io/api-reference/get-an-integrations-metrics-and-sync-data) API endpoint.

- **Prometheus Metrics Endpoint**  
  If you are using the **self hosted integration method**, you can get raw Prometheus metrics by accessing the following endpoint: `{your_integration_base_url}/metrics`.
