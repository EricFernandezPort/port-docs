## Monitoring and Sync Status

To access the integration's monitoring metrics and sync status, navigate to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page, under the `Exporters` section select your integration.  

    The `Sync Status` tab offers a detailed overview of the data ingestion and reconciliation processeses.  
    It includes the following sections:  

    ### Sync by kind 
    Shows the montioring metrics and sync status for each `kind`.  

    **Sync stages overview**:
        - **Fetch data**:  
        The first step in the data ingestion process is fetching the data from the data source.  
          In this section, you will find the following fields:
          - Fetched: Number of objects fetched from the data source.
          - Failed: If the fetch fails, this field will show `1` and `Fetched` will show `0`. Otherwise, it shows `0`.
        - **Map data**:  
        The next step is mapping these objects according to the integration's [mapping configuration](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping).  
          In this section, you will find the following fields:
          - Transformed: Number of objects that were mapped to blueprint entities.
          - Filtered out: Number of objects that were filtered out according to the mapping conditions.
          - Failed: Number of objects that failed to map, you can find more information about the failure reasons in the **Troubleshooting tips** section below in the UI or refer to the `Event log` tab, available in the same window.
        - **Ingest to Port**:  
        Final step is ingesting the mapped objects to Port.  
          In this section, you will find the following fields:
          - Ingested: Number of objects that were ingested successfully.
          - Not changed: Number of objects that were already up to date, so no changes were made to them.
          - Failed: Number of objects that failed to ingest. To learn more about the failure reasons, see the `Event log` tab, available in the same window.
      
    **Details**: Displays the duration of the sync.  

    ### Reconciliation
    This section provides visibility into both the reingestion and deletion processes.  
    When the `createMissingRelatedEntities` flag is set to `false`, Port will **not** automatically create related entities that are referenced in the mapping but not yet present in Port.  

    The reingestion process ensures that once the missing related entities are ingested, the dependent entities will be reingested.  

    The deletion process ensures that entities that are no longer present in the data source are removed.  
    
    **Reconciliation overview**: 
    - **Reingest**:  
      -   Reingested entities: Displays the number of entities that were ingested successfully on retry after dependencies resolved.  
      -  Failed: Displays the number of entities that failed to reingest.
    - **Delete**: 
      -   Deleted entities: Displays the number of entities that were removed from Port to match the data source.
      -   Failed: Displays the number of entities that failed to delete.  
    
    **Details**: Displays the duration of the reconciliation.

    **Note**: The same data is also available through the [Get an integration's metrics and sync status](https://docs.port.io/api-reference/get-an-integrations-metrics-and-sync-status) API endpoint.
