## Metrics and Sync Status

You can monitor the sync status of your integration in two ways:

- **Prometheus Metrics Endpoint**  
  You can get a Prometheus file with raw metrics, by using `{your_integration's_baseUrl}/metrics` endpoint.

- **Sync Status Tab**  
    Navigate to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page, under the `Exporters` section, select your integration.  
    In the `Sync Status` tab, you will find information regarding the sync status and other metrics.
