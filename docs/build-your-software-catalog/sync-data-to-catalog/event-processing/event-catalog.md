# Event catalog

Port acts as an event catalog for event-driven architectures, serving as a centralized repository for your event schemas, API schemas, documentation, as well as mapping the relationships between event producers and consumers in your overall architecture.

## Common use cases

- Map relationships between events, producers, and consumers in your event-driven architecture.
- Document all event schemas and APIs so developers have the information needed to write new services.
- Automatically ingest schemas, producer/consumer relationships, and APIs to ensure the catalog is up to date.

## Data model overview

<img src='/img/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/event-processing/event-catalog-data-model.png' width='90%' />

Your architecture in Port will consist of four blueprints: `Producer`, `Event Pipeline`, `Event`, and `Consumer`. The structure of these blueprints may vary based on your architecture and may be different than the examples provided in this guide.

### Producer

- The `Producer` blueprint represents services that will generate events. It has a [relation](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/relate-blueprints/) connecting it to the event pipeline blueprint.
  
### Event pipeline

- The `Event Pipeline` blueprint represents services that will act as a queue for events and route them to the proper destination. The `Event Pipeline` blueprint has one relation with the `Event` blueprint for events that are ingested by the pipeline, another relation with the `Event` blueprint for events that are produced from the pipeline, and finally the pipeline has a relation connecting it to the `Consumer` blueprint. 

### Event

- The `Event` blueprint forms the schema for tracking unique events in your event-driven architecture. It has a relation connecting it to the producers which originally generated the event and a relation connecting it to the consumers which consumed the event. 

### Consumer

- The `Consumer` blueprint represents services that consume events generated by the event pipeline.


## Data model configuration

### Blueprint deployment

:::tip Already deployed?
If you already have blueprints in Port for the services that are serving as your event producer, event consumer, and event pipeline you can skip the deployment for those blueprints
:::

Each blueprint is represented by a [Json schema](https://json-schema.org/), as shown in the following section:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "myIdentifier",
  "title": "My title",
  "description": "My description",
  "icon": "My icon",
  "calculationProperties": {},
  "schema": {
    "properties": {
      "myProp1": {
        "type": "my_type",
        "title": "My title"
      },
      "myProp2": {
        "type": "my_special_type",
        "title": "My special title"
      }
    },
    "required": []
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```
