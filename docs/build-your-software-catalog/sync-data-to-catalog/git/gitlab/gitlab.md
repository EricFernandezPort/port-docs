# GitLab

Our integration with GitLab allows you to export GitLab objects to Port as entities of existing blueprints. The integration supports real-time event processing so Port always provides an accurate real-time representation of your GitLab resources.

## ðŸ’¡ GitLab integration common use cases

Our GitLab integration makes it easy to fill the software catalog with data directly from your GitLab workspace, for example:

- Map all of the resources in your GitLab workspace, including **projects**, **merge requests** and other GitLab objects;
- Watch for GitLab object changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your entities in Port;
- etc.

## Installation

To install Port's GitLab Integration, follow the [installation](./installation.md) guide.
