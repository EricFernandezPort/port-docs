# Installation

This page details how to install Port's GitHub integration (powered by the Ocean framework).

This page outlines the following steps:

- How to [create](#create-an-access-token) an access token to give the integration permissions to query your Github organization.
- How to [configure](#configure-the-integration) and customize the integration before deploying it.
- How to [deploy](#deploy-the-integration) the integration in the configuration that fits your use case.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with permissions to create access tokens.
- Your Port user role is set to `Admin`.

## Setup

### Configure access token

To allow Port to fetch data from your GitHub Organization, you need to create an access token. Port supports two types of tokens for authentication: personal access tokens and GitHub app installation tokens.

#### Personal access token (PAT)

A Personal Access Token (PAT) is suitable if you're the only one managing the integration and don't need frequent credential rotation.  
To create a personal access token see Github's [managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

- The token must belong to a user with access to the relevant Github resources (e.g., repositories, teams).

<details>
  <summary>Required permissions</summary>

  These are the necessary permissions if you're creating a fine-grained PAT.

  **Repository permissions:**
  - **Content**: Readonly
  - **Metadata**: Readonly
  - **Pull Requests**: Readonly
  
  **Organization permissions:**
  - **Webhooks**: Read and Write (for managing webhook)
</details>

#### Github app installation

Refer to our [Github app installation guide](./github-app.mdx)

### Configure Realtime webhook events

:::tip
The `baseUrl` parameter is used specifically to enable the real-time functionality of the integration.

If it is not provided, the integration will continue to function correctly. In such a configuration, to retrieve the latest information from the target system, the [`scheduledResyncInterval`](https://ocean.getport.io/develop-an-integration/integration-configuration/#scheduledresyncinterval---run-scheduled-resync) parameter has to be set, or a manual resync will need to be triggered through Port's UI.

## Deploy the integration
