# Github V2

Port's GitHub integration allows you to model GitHub resources in your software catalog and ingest data into them.

## Overview

This integration allows you to:

- Map and organize your desired GitHub resources and their metadata in Port (see supported resources below).
- Watch for GitHub object changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your software catalog.
- Manage Port entities using GitOps.
- Trigger GitHub workflows directly from Port.
