### Limit field

When creating a blueprint property of type {props.property_name} in the UI, you can configure its **Limit** field to control how many values can be selected.  

In the property creation form, the Limit field dropdown provides two options:

- **1 value**: Only one value can be selected.
- **List of values**: Users can select more than one value.

Selecting **list of values** will set the property's `type` to `array` in the JSON definition.

:::info Limit field restriction
The Limit setting, whether **1 value** or **list of values**, is permanent and cannot be changed after the property is created.

If you create a {props.property_name} property with a single value Limit, you wonâ€™t be able to change it later to allow multiple values.  

To change the Limit configuration after creation, you have two options:
- Create a new property with the **Limit** field set to a **list of values**.
- Use the [migrate blueprint data](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/migrate-data/) feature.
