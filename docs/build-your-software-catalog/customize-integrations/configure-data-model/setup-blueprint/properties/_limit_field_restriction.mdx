:::info Limit field restriction
The `limit` field must be defined as either accepting a single value or a list of values.  
This setting is permanent and cannot be changed after the property is created.

If you create a {props.property_name} property with a single-value `limit`, you won't be able to later change it to support multiple values.  
To support multiple values, you can either define a new property with `limit` set to a list, or use the [migrate blueprint data](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/migrate-data/) feature.
