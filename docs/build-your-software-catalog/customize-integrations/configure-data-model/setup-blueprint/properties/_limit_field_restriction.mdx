:::info Limit field restriction
The `limit` field must be defined as either accepting a single value or a list of values.
This setting becomes permanent after the property is created and cannot be changed later.

If you create the {props.property_name} property and limit it to a single value, you won't be able to switch it later to support multiple values.
To support multiple values, you'll need to define a new property with `limit` set to list.
