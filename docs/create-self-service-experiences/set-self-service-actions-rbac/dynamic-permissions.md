# Dynamic permissions

Port allows setting dynamic permissions for executing and/or approving execution of self-service actions, based on any properties/relations of an action's corresponding blueprint.

## Potential use-cases

Examples of useful applications of dynamic permissions:

- Ensure that action executions requested by a team member can only be approved by his/her direct manager.
- An action that terminates a service can only be executed if that service has no unresolved incindents.

## Configuring permissions

To use dynamic permissions:

- Go to your [`builder`](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model) page.
- Choose the blueprint that is coupled to the Action you want to set permissions for.
- Click on the `...` icon of the blueprint, then click on `Permissions`.

![blueprintEditPermissions](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/rbac/blueprintEditPermissions.png)

The blueprint's permission configuration in JSON format will open in a new window. Here you can define permissions for entities and actions belonging to the blueprint.

:::info Note
Currently, dynamic permissions are supported only for actions. Support for entities will be available soon ðŸ˜Ž
:::

Look for the `"actions"` key, and under it find the name of the action you want to set permissions for.  
Each action has the following two keys under it:

- `"execute"` - any logic defined here pertains to the execution of the action. Here you can define who can run action.
- `"approve"` - any logic defined here pertains to the approval of the action. If "manual approval" is not enabled for this action, this key is irrelevant since no approval is needed.

Under each of these two keys, you can add a `policy` key, which allows you to use more complex logic using two keys:

1. ["queries"](/search-and-query/) - a collection of [rules](/search-and-query/#rules) you can use to get/filter the data you need.
2. "conditions" - an array of strings, where each string is a jq query with access to the `"queries"` data.

              ],
              "combinator": "and"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Guidelines

- You can define any number of queries you wish for execution/approve policies.
-

## Complete example

Here is an example of a permissions JSON belonging to a simple `service` blueprint.
Note the `scaffold_new_microservice` action (line 84):

- The `approve` key under it contains a `policy` key which indicates that some additional logic is defined here that determines who can approve an exeution of this action.

The `scaffold_new_microservice` action can be approved only by the team leader of the user that asked to execute the action.
