title: ðŸ§± Setup Actions
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"

Choose the name, description and icon of the action to make it recognizable.

Select the user inputs you would like the user to fill out to use the action.

Port supports various input types, including constructing wizards with conditions and steps to best fit the experience you want for your users.

Setting up an action includes the following steps:

1. **Define [action information](#structure-table)** - the title, icon, description and associated [blueprint](../../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md);
2. **Select the [user inputs](#userinputs---form--wizard-ui)** - create a wizard-like experience by specifying the input types users need to fill in, while also including input validations;
3. **Configure the [action type](#trigger--action-type)** - Create/Day-2/Delete;
4. **Connect the action to a [backend](#invocationmethod---connect-to-a-backend** - for every action you define in Port, you tell Port what component is responsible to handle the action's invocation. This is called the **invocation method**, Port supports various invocation methods for different use cases and environments;
5. **Configure RBAC and guardrails** - this optional step lets you choose who can trigger an action, does the action require manual approval from an admin, and who has the permissions to approve or dismiss requests.

## ðŸ’¡ Common actions

Actions can be used to execute any logic that you choose, for example:

- Scaffold a new microservice;
- Deploy a new version;
- Lock deployments;
- Add a secret;
- Spin up a temporary developer environment;
- Extend an environment's TTL;
- Provision a cloud resource;
- Update the pod count of a service;
- Update the auto-scaling group;
- Change customer configuration;
- Train a machine learning model;
- Pre-process a dataset;
- etc.

In this [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/self-serve) example, we can see the Self-Service Hub page with example actions. ðŸŽ¬

## Action structure

Each action is represented by a [Json schema](https://json-schema.org/), as shown in the following section:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "internalID",
  "identifier": "myIdentifier",
  "title": "My title",
  "description": "My description",
  "icon": "My icon",
  "userInputs": {
    "properties": {
      "myInput1": {
        "type": "my_type",
        "title": "My input"
      },
      "myInput2": {
        "type": "my_special_type",
        "title": "My special input"
      }
    },
    "required": []
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "myInvocationType"
  },
  "trigger": "myActionTrigger",
  "requiredApproval": false
}
```

### Structure table

@Mor, please add a column of Notes describing the use of Id (by API), and the fact that indicating the type of the action, Port will automatically place the action in the right place in the Developer Portal to make it accessible and indicative for the user. The type of the action is part of the metadata provided by Port to the backend implementing the action to know either to Create a new resource, deleting it or affect an existing resource. END COMMENT FOR MOR

An action consist of several properties:

:::tip available user inputs
All available user inputs are listed in the [user inputs](./user-inputs/user-inputs.md) page
:::

### `userInputs` - Form & Wizard UI

Port actions support a variety of user inputs which make it easy to create UI forms and wizards.

By using user inputs, you can specify to your users exactly what information your backend requires to handle the action request. In addition, the user inputs provide validation support out-of-the-box, making it easy to put guardrails in place and make sure that input values are standardized.

To learn more about user inputs, refer to the [user inputs](./user-inputs/user-inputs.md) page.

### `trigger`- Action type

Port actions support 3 action types:

- `CREATE` - create actions are used to create new new assets and resources, and are not tied to an existing entity from the software catalog;
- `DAY-2` - day-2 operation actions are used to modify, change, enhance or add to existing resources and entities in the software catalog;
- `DELETE` - delete actions are used to trigger the organized deletion of existing resources and their respective entities in the software catalog.

Different action types also include specific representation in the software catalog UI:

- Each action type has a separate section in the [Self-Service Hub](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) page;
- In the blueprints table, `CREATE` actions appear as a global button, not tied to any specific entity;
- In the blueprints table and [entity page](../../customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page.md#entity-page), `DAY-2` and `DELETE` actions appear specifically on the entity you wish to trigger the action on.

### `invocationMethod` - Connect to a backend

Port actions support a variety of target backends that can be triggered when an action is invoked.

The different backends are denoted and configured via the `invocationMethod` key, the available methods are:

- **Webhook** - setup a webhook URL to receive and handle forms and wizards submissions;
- **Kafka** - subscribe to Kafka topic to listen to messages with forms and wizards submissions;
- **CI Native (Github Workflow)** - setup Port's [GitHub app](../../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/github.md) to handle forms & wizards submission via Github Workflows;
- **CI Native (Azure Pipeline)**- setup a webhook type service connection to trigger Azure pipelines and handle forms & wizards submission via Github Workflows;
- **Port agent** - setup Port's agent tp receive forms & wizards submissions and forward them to your backend on your internal network.

To learn more about the different available invocation methods and backends, refer to the [setup backend](../setup-backend/setup-backend.md) page.

### `requireApproval` - Require manual approval (optional)

Port actions support a manual approval process. Manual approvals let you control who can approve an action invocation request, and also handle notifying the relevant personas when an action request is awaiting their review.

refer to the [self-service actions RBAC](../set-self-service-action-rbac/set-self-service-action-rbac.md) page to learn more.
